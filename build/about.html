          <p>
            The Jewish Play Project will promote understanding of
            the intersections of Judaism and Play, in religious,
            cultural, secular and commercial worlds.
            
          </p>
          <p>In pursit of this mission we wish to support enquiry into...</p>
          <p>
            The role of Jewish inventors, designers and entrepreneurs
            in the past, present and future play industries.
          </p>
          <p>
            The role of Play, toys and games in Jewish religious
            practice and culture
            
          </p>
          <p>
            Our first effort in this space is the interactive timeline
            on Jewish Inventors, Designers and Entrepreneurs.
            In the future we hope to expand this resource into a fully
            searchable research database open to contributors from
            academia and industry. We also aspire to support formal and
            informal education and scholarship and pure and applied work
            in this space.

          <h2 class="t2">How it came about:</h2>
          <p>
            Two years ago Professor Stephen Jacobs and Rabbi Robert Morais
            began discussing the potential for an exhibit on Judaism,
            play, toys and games for the JCC of Metro Detroit’s Shalom
            Street Museum. That discussion led to Shalom Street's current
            exhibition, “Across the Board: From Dreidel to XBOX:
            The toys and games of the Jewish People”
          </p>
          <p>
            During Professor Jacobs' research on the “Toymakers Hall of Fame”
            section in the summer of 2014, it became clear that there was a
            much larger story to tell than then exhibit itself could support
            and so the the idea for the Jewish Play Project was born.
