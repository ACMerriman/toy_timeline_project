        h2.t1 Selected and Preliminary List of Companies and Designers
        p The following list focuses primarily founders, inventors or designers. There are many others who have been post-founding presidents or corporate officers,, many who made key contributions, that are currently not listed but as this resource grows in sophistication and is replaced by a true database, more will be added. The same goes for representing the role of those who worked in one toy company before founding their own.
        p The list covers a period from the 1830’s to the present and, especially in the earlier time periods, covers European and US companies. This list is extensive but by no means comprehensive. Several of the people listed could have been put under several different headings, and again a more robust database will be more flexible in how we present information moving forward.
        p All that said, it should serve as an initial indicator of the impact Jewish Designers, Entrepreneurs and Inventors have had on play in the past 180 years.
